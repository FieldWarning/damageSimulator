A simple tool used to simulate different damage models that will be used to support the development of the game engine *Project Field Warning*.
Originally created by flkXI (ctigrisht on GitHub).

GUI branch is the damage simulation tool for weapon designers or players who need to calculate the time needed to kill a target depending on the weaponry they choose

Classes branch contains all the classes and methods that the game devs will need to implement the damage system into P:FW.

Everything should be explained clearly enough in the comments... (if the branch is updated to the latest version)
